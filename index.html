            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control systems or VCS is basically a common place for project files that allows a team of editors to simultaneously check files out, make changes, and then check them back in or even commit them to be finalized. Versioning control systems allows editors to merge changes to same files, show what new information has been added to a file by someone else, and also the revision history of a file and the exact time of when they where changed. Benefits of VCS’s include that there’s one common repository that holds all the files, files cannot be overwritten, and version control systems backup your files so you don’t have to worry about changes being made or even keeping up with your team! VCS allows for file projects to be successfully worked on by a team and not just yourself. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Local repositories are places where a user edits and saves personal work done to files and codes before sending it off to a remote repository for others to view. Local repositories can be described as the place where you do all your work in, or for lack of better words, your workspace. In the local repo, when your finished editing a file you send it off to the remote repository, which is usually in this case Github.  Local repositories are very great for projects because you can change branches, view any file’s history, and commit changes without needing a network connection. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Next, remote repositories in a nutshell is the place in which you send your final project files and codes over to be seen or worked on by others. In our case, the remote repository is hosted on a server like GitHub, which we are using in this class. The remote repository is just like the local repository except at the remote repository you share finalized projects with others. When you’re using the local repository to edit files, In order to send it to the remote repository you “push” the file over. Remote repositories are very beneficial to group projects because it allows people to collaborate on files without having information become lost or destroyed.  </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is the software that has out paced software’s like SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase. Git offers features no other software can provide with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows. Git is simple, flexible, and easily sharable by various project or team participants. Git is designed for speed because it minimizes resources related to product and web development, even with massive projects. Participants don’t have to start a new project from scratch using Git, a developer can simply retrieve and changed stored codes to maximize efficiency. Some basic Git commands are: git init, git add, git commit, git log, and git status. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GitHub is the web-based Git or version control repository and internet hosting service. In this class, we are using Githug to upload our codes from our local repository to the remote repository on GitHub. Projects on GitHub can be accessed and manipulated using the Git commands and the interface. On GitHub, even if you aren’t signed up with an account you are still free to browse public peositories on the site. GitHub is the next big thing when it comes to repositories. As Git is faster and more dependable than previous software’s, GitHub allows its users to collaborate on projects through a safe and secure platform. </p>
